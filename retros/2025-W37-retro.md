## Reflections
- Made good progress on HoneyHub with Sentry and Resend implementations, enhancing the platform's reliability and communication capabilities.
- The AI Architect tasks were completed successfully, providing a solid foundation for future AI projects.
- Need to prioritize learning Arduino tools to expand skill set and project capabilities.
- Still need to work on maintaining a consistent routine for eating and working out to support overall productivity and well-being.



## Next Focus
- Work on blog
- Continue learning Arduino tools
- Create background worker for HoneyHub
