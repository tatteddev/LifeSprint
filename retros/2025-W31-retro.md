# Retro 2025-W31

## ✅ Completed

- HoneyHub Framework moved to HoneyHub
- CI/CD set up for HoneyHub Framework

## ❌ Missed

- No art done
- No Blender tutorial
- Did not finish 3D essentials course
- Did not finish Audio Essentials course
- Did not have a full week of eating and working out

## Reflections
- Moved the HoneyHub framework to HoneyHub and set up CI/CD, which was a significant step forward.
- Did not make progress on art or Blender tutorials, which was disappointing.
- Need to prioritize art and Blender tutorials in the next sprint.
- Eating and working out were not consistent, which affected overall productivity.

## Next Focus

- Dev and Art
