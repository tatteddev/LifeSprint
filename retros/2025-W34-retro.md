# Retro 2025-W33

## ✅ Completed

- Worked out and ate well for 5 days


## ❌ Missed
- Did not finish Section 2 in Complete Blender Creator
- Did not start ART over (Marc Brunet)
- Did not finish Programming Essentials course
- Did not set up users API in HoneyHub
- Did not read 3 chapters of Robot Builders Bonanza


## Reflections

- Maintained a healthy routine for most of the week
- Got a puppy, which has been a great companion but also requires time and attention
- Will need to balance puppy care with work and personal goals
- I am going to prioritize HoneyHub for the rest of the year

## Next Focus

- honeyhub
